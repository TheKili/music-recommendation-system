- [ ] write a function that 
	- [ ] returns a dataframe/et (find best!) for each song and k song-recommendations
	- [ ] contains a subsample and document computation time 
	- [ ] calculates pairwise-distances between songs based on feature criteria
	- [ ] using cosine as a distance feature
	- [ ] (experimenting with other distance measurements and document pros/cons in [[distance measures list]])
	- [ ] (think about how to weight different features)
- [ ] write a function that 
	- [ ] takes spotify-song id as an input parameter 
	- [ ] looks up spotify song in data structure created before
	- [ ] returns list of k song-recommendations
- [ ] implement a structure to best save the lists
	- [ ] google big query: either 1) saving each potential dissimilarity list as a table with rows as songs and column *k* as *k*th song recommendation or try to combine those information in one table
